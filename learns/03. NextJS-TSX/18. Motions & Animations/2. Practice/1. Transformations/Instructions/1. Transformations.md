### Exercise 1: Basic Translation

Create a box that moves across the screen.

1.  Create a simple box using a `div`.
2.  Use Motion to animate the box from the left side of the screen to the right.

### Exercise 2: Vertical Movement

Make a circle bounce up and down.

1.  Create a circle using CSS.
2.  Animate the circle to move vertically, bouncing at the top and bottom of the container.

### Exercise 3: Rotation Animation

Spin an icon continuously.

1.  Use an SVG icon or image.
2.  Animate the icon to rotate indefinitely.

### Exercise 4: Skewed Transition

Animate a rectangle that skews when clicked.

1.  Create a rectangle using tailwind CSS.
2.  On click, skew the rectangle and return to normal when clicked again.

### Exercise 5: Combined Transformations

Create a complex animation combining multiple transformations.

1.  Create a shape (e.g., a square or circle).
2.  Animate the shape to move diagonally while rotating and scaling simultaneously.

### Exercise 6: Sequential Transformations

Create an animation sequence.

1.  Use multiple elements (e.g., squares).
2.  Animate them in a sequence where one moves right, then the next one follows after a delay, using different transformations (e.g., move, rotate).
