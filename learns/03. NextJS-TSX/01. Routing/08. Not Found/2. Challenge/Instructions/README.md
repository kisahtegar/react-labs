### Exercise: Creating a Custom "Not Found" Page in Next.js

The goal of this exercise is to practice creating a custom "Not Found" (404) page in a Next.js application to improve the user experience when accessing non-existing routes.

#### Instructions:

1. In your Next.js project, create a custom error page named "not-found.tsx" in the "app" directory. This page will serve as the custom "Not Found" page for your application.

2. Customize the "not-found.tsx" page with a message or content to inform users that the page they are looking for does not exist.

3. Verify that when accessing a non-existing route, users are redirected to the custom "Not Found" page (not-found.tsx) and see the message you provided.
