### Challenge: Handling Dynamic URL Segments in Next.js

Practice catch all routes segments in Next.js. Your task is to create a route that dynamically processes and displays multiple URL segments.

#### Instructions:

- Inside the `app` directory, create a new folder named `products`.

- Inside the `products` folder, create a folder named `[...slug]`.

- Inside the `[...slug]` folder, create a `page.tsx` file that will render information based on the dynamic segments from the URL.

- Inside `page.tsx`, display the entire `slug` array, showing each segment of the URL dynamically.
