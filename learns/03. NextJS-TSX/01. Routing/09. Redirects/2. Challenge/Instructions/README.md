### Exercise: Implementing Redirects in Next.js

The goal of this exercise is to practice setting up and managing redirects in a Next.js application to enhance user experience and ensure proper page navigation.

#### Instructions:

- Create a custom error page named "not-found.tsx" in the "app" directory. This page will serve as the custom not-found error page for your application.

- Implement redirects for the following scenarios:

- Create a redirection rule that redirects users from the route "/old-page" to the new page "/new-page."
- Create a rule that redirects users from a non-existing route "/non-existing" to the custom 404 error page "not-found.tsx."
